# minor-details-app-showcase
I built this web app for my client, Minor Details, enabling 300+ employees to coordinate with 50+ dealership partners through a real-time service ticket dashboard. Built with ReactJS, Firebase, and AI automation, it streamlines workflows, tracks performance, and drives seven-figure revenues.
